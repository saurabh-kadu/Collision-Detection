# Collision-Detection(ball)
Collision Detection using PR Quad Tree
The naive approach of collision detection is to check for each pair of objects(ball) if they are colliding or not(very high time complexity).
But using PR Quad tree we can decrease the time complexity by saving the objects(ball) in the PR Quad Tree and using it to check the pairs for collision which lie in the same region.
